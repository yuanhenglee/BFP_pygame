    motion planning demo using potential field method and BFS
  </p>
</div>


A python visualization of motion planning. It allows you to draw obstacles and robots on a 128*128 map, and find a path between any two configurations.
## Features

### Calculating Potential Field
Two different ways( NF1, NF2 ) are used to calculate the potential values.

### Pathfinding
Pathfinding using Best First Search algorithm.

### Custom Map
Obstacles and robots can be set with input files (like those in `Dat`), or it can also be configured using GUI interface.

## Usage
```shell
python3
```
## Requirements
* Python 3.9.9
* Pygame 1.9.6
